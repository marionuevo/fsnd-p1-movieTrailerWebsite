# Full Stack ND P1: Movie Trailer Website

This is the 1st project of the FullStack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

The goal for this project was to build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. I wrote the server side code to store a list of movie titles, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. Additionally, I added release year and directors name.

## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/v3.3.4.zip).
